#Why React?

### Fast Learning Curve
- very a simple and lightweight library that only deals with the view layer.

### Reusable Components
- provides a component based structure. Components are reusable and can be seen as lego pieces. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and you can create wrapper components composed of those smaller components.

### Fast render with Virtual DOM
- javascript engines are fast enough to handle complex applications which requires high user interaction and view updates, DOM manipulations are still not that fast. Updating DOM is usually the bottleneck when it comes to the web performance. React is trying to solve this problem by using something called virtual DOM; a DOM kept in memory.

### Clean Abstraction
-  it provides a good abstraction which means that it does not expose any complex internals to the user
- there is one good architecture that fits React really well called Flux.

### Flux and Redux
- Flux architecture is introduced and maintained by Facebook and they use it for their web applications. It complements React components by unidirectional data flow.

### Great Developer Tools
- React Developer Tools and Redux Developer Tools. Both can be installed as Chrome extensions.

### React Native
- Learning React comes with a bonus: React Native.

## In sort:
     Virtual DOM: Speed.
     Component: Resuable (and cleaner) Web components.
     Maintained by Facebook.
     Hirable.
